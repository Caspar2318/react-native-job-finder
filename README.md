# First React Native Mobile App practice, a Job Finder!

# Link via: https://expo.dev/@caspar_expo/react-native-job-finder?serviceType=classic&disstribution=expo-go (Can only open via Android 'Expo Go' app)

start with Expo Router

https://expo.github.io/router

npx create-expo-app@latest -e with-router ./

add "app" folder and inside app folder create "index.js" and "\_layout.js" file.

for layout reference at https://expo.github.io/router/docs/guides/

add more packages thru command:

npm install expo-font axios react-native-dotenv

npm start => to start the server => download "Expo go" mobile app to see link with QR code to check phone version and also can check web version through link provided.

(if this doesn't work, the alternative method is to run command "npm install -g expo-cli" and then run "expo-cli start --tunnel")

while building app, if mobile app crushes, and no error inside code, press 'r' inside command line to reload mobile app, sometimes reload few times the error will go.

npm install -g expo-cli

expo pulish
